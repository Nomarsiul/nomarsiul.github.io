    <p>According to
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stoicism"><b>Wikipedia:</b></a> Stoicism is a school of Hellenistic
        philosophy that flourished in Ancient Greece and Ancient Rome. The Stoics
        believed that the practice of virtue is enough to achieve eudaimonia: <b>a well-lived life</b>. The
        Stoics
        identified
        the path to achieving it with a life spent practicing certain virtues in everyday life such as courage or
        temperance and living in accordance with nature. It was founded in the ancient Agora of Athens by Zeno of Citium
        around 300 BC.

        <li>It's not what happens to you, but how you react to it that matters.</li>
        <li>Only the educated are free.</li>
        <li>Seek not the good in external things; seek it in yourselves.</li>
    </ol>
    <h2><b>Marcus Aurelius</b></h2>

        <li>You have power over your mind â€” not outside events. Realize this, and you will find strength.</li>
        <li>Do not act as if you were going to live ten thousand years. Death hangs over you. While you live, while it
            is in your power, be good.</li>
        <li>The happiness of your life depends upon the quality of your thoughts.</li>
    </ol>

    <ol>
        <li>We suffer more often in imagination than in reality.</li>
        <li>It is not that we have so little time but that we lose so much. </li>
        <li>Luck is what happens when preparation meets opportunity.</li>
